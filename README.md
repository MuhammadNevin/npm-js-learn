# npm-learn

## Overview
This project is a learning exercise to understand npm packages, including how to publish, update, and manage them. It demonstrates the use of various JavaScript libraries and Node.js modules to perform common tasks such as file operations, date formatting, and mathematical calculations.

## Features
- **Lodash Integration**: Demonstrates string manipulation using the `lodash` library.
- **Moment.js Integration**: Logs the current date and time in a formatted string.
- **Custom Utility Functions**: Includes functions for mathematical operations and greeting messages.
- **File Operations**: Writes and reads content to/from text files using Node.js's `fs` module.

## Project Structure

### 1. `dependency.js`
Demonstrates the use of the `lodash` library. It imports `lodash` and uses the `camelCase` function to convert a string (`"hello world"`) into camel case format.

### 2. `import.js`
Imports a `writeFile` function from the `write.js` module. It writes a string (`"Import\nHello, this is a test file."`) to a file named `output_import.txt` and logs a confirmation message.

### 3. `index.js`
Contains utility functions:
- `sayHello(name)`: Logs a greeting message.
- `factorial(n)`: Recursively calculates the factorial of a number.
- `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between two numbers.

### 4. `moment.js`
Demonstrates the use of the `moment` library. It logs the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`.

### 5. `output_import.txt`
A text file generated by `import.js`. It contains the following content:
```
Import
Hello, this is a test file.
```

### 6. `output.txt`
Another text file that contains the following content:
```
Hello, this is a test file.
```

### 7. `write.js`
Defines a `writeFile` function that writes content to a specified file path using Node.js's `fs` module.
